Project---------- TA Application
=========================================================================================

About the project
=================
The project is to create a web page that Professors or university staffs or students could log in and create an application or assign Teaching assistants


Web Scraper features
=================================
I have everything except for save and post data to TAApplication. I tried scraping 2019 to 2022 on both CS and EAE
departments, but I trusth that it will work on other departments and years as well. 


Time Out Value
==============
I chose implicit wait and the value is 5 seconds. I chose 5 seconds because the school's website generally responses by 5 seconds.

HTMLAgilityPack vs Selenium
==========================
Selinium is used for automation when high agility pack preferred for fast testing with less resource

Comments Selenium
=================
The most difficult about selenium for me was figuring out how to store loaded page and getting the right Xpaths.
Most elements I require do not have id and Xpaths were the only options. But Xpaths could be different for
the same kind of structure since divison numbers or list numbers could change based on the page. 

It would be not too difficult to use Selenium for my URC project since it is an open source and Selenium
is easy to use. 





Note
====
Make sure to maximize google chrome's view when testing. 


Above and beyond
================
No functionality improvement however I did add nice lookings bootstrap5 features.
